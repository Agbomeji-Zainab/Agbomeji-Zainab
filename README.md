# Hello, I'm Agbomeji Zainab! 👋

## 🎓 MSc Data Science | 💻 Aspiring Data Scientist

I am currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science, and I have hands-on experience in building machine learning models, analyzing data, and using statistical techniques to extract insights. I enjoy working with Python and its powerful data science libraries, and I am continuously learning and expanding my skill set.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Deep Learning**, **Neural Networks**, and **Advanced Machine Learning Techniques**

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL, R
- **Libaries**: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn
- **Data B Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaboorn
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised/Unsupervised Learning
- **Tools & Platform**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab


## 🌟 Featured Project

### [Calories Burned Prediction with Decision Trees](https://github.com/Agbomeji-Zainab/GMET-Project)
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the number of calories burned based on various factors such as age, weight, and activity duration. I used a Decision Tree classifier to build the model, tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance, and evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Key Techniques**: Decision Tree, Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Evaluation
- **Outcome**: Achieved [mention accuracy/performance if available] accuracy in predicting calories burned.
