## 🌟 Featured Project

### [Calories Burned Prediction with Decision Trees](https://github.com/Agbomeji-Zainab/GMET-Project)
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the number of calories burned based on various factors such as age, weight, and other activity in a Gym Dataset. I used a Decision Tree classifier to build the model.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Key Techniques**: Decision Tree, Model Evaluation
- **Outcome**: The decision tree model performed well in predicting the number of calories burned, with an R² score of 0.7633 on the test data.
